I have already done some of the part 2 and part 3, so I wish they will not be graded. 

(1) Run
    You will see the shell is waiting for your input

(2) Run
    /bin/ls
    You will see the content in this directory and also the ouput :"Program was successful"
    This is because /bin/ls is an absoulte path so it will show the content of this directory
(3) Run
    nothing
    For this step, you just input nothing and press enter, you will see nothing happen,it will show ffosh:/home/cy146/ece551/mp_miniproject$ again and wait for your input
    This is because nothing will be execute
(4) Run
    space
    For this step you need to enter some space character in the shell and you will find it will do nothing and re-output the prompt again and wait for your input
    This is because after you input only space, they will be treat as you input nothing

(5) Run
    erejiwoefe
    This step, you need to enter some odd thing
    it will show erejiwoefe not find and wait for your input again

(6) Run
    exit
    this step you need to enter the exit to exit the program 
    after you enter the exit the program will exit successfully

(7) Run
    ./shell
    this step you need execute ./shell
    it will show Terminated by signal 0
    this is because you can not execute this program another time
(8) Run
    ./a.out 2
    for this step you execute the program write by myself
    you will get "There are total 2 arguments Program was successful" and wait for input again
